# Modern Microservices Architecture Showcase

This project demonstrates core **microservices concepts** using modern **Spring ecosystem features**, **reactive programming**, **messaging**, and **monitoring tools**. It includes multiple example services to illustrate different architectures and patterns.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot & Spring WebFlux (Reactive)**
- **Spring Cloud Gateway & API Gateway**
- **Service Registry (Eureka)**
- **JWT Authentication**
- **Reactive Security & Authorization**
- **Kafka Messaging** (Event-driven architecture)
- **Centralized Configuration**
- **Distributed Logging**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana
- **Distributed Tracing:** Tempo

---

## Project Structure

1. ### Authentication & Reactive Service
   - Uses **Spring WebFlux** and **JWT** for secure reactive endpoints
   - Demonstrates **non-blocking, reactive microservices patterns**

2. ### Kafka & Reactive Web Services
   - Event-driven architecture using **Kafka** for messaging between services
   - Reactive REST endpoints handling high-throughput, asynchronous processing

3. ### Monitoring & Sample Services
   - Monitoring service integrated with **Prometheus & Grafana**
   - Sample microservices demonstrating **logging, tracing, and service registry**

## How to Run

Make sure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed, then run eac:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
